## How to run the website

1. Make sure Python3.8 is installed (this is the only version I have tested)
 - `pip install` the following (if they are missing): `flask`, `functools`, `requests_ntlm`, `requests`
2. To start the website server: `python3 server.py`
3. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to see the website
4. You can login using email address `micksadowsky@gmail.com`, leave the password empty.
