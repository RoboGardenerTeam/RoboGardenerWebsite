## How to run the website

1. Make sure Python3.8 is installed (this is the only version I have tested)
2. `pip install` the following (if they are missing): `flask`, `functools`, `requests_ntlm`, `requests`
3. To start the website server: `python3 server.py`
4. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to see the website
5. You can login using email address `micksadowsky@gmail.com`, leave the password empty.
